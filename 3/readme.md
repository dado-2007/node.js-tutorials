# Tutorial 3

  - [x] Understand what a js engine is.
    - A js engine is responsable for converting javascript into machine code(computer just understand machine code).
  - [x] Understand and know different programming levels(ex.: low(assembly, machine code and maybe c/c++), high(javascript, python, c#, ruby, etc...).
    - Low level programming is closer to machine code or binaries like giving commands directly to the cpu, and high level programming is further, it is easiest like web development.


### So about node...
  - Node.js is written in c++.
  - At the heart of node is google's v8 js engine.
  - This v8 engine is what in node converts javascript code into machine code.
